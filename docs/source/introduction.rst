Lets Keep It Simple
***********************

A training platform for AI **models**. 

Why a platform?
========================
The internet is full of tutorials about how to set up a machine learning experiment, 
how to train a convolutional neural network or how to optimize the hyperparameters of a model.
So many programming languages with the corresponding libraries, multiple datasets to choose among, 
tones of papers suggesting models to get cutting-edge results ..., allow a quick rump up for almost everyone.
After a couple of weeks, any one with basic programming skills should be able to train a model and 
use it for prediction in several scenarios. 

At the time that you feel that you are on the "top of the hill", many others are wasting time and CPU cycles
going through the same process as you did few weeks before. 

In current literature there is a lack of information about critical topics such as how to share models and test results,
to stablish criteria to evaluate model performance or how to setup a relevant benchmarking strategy. 
The same result can be found when talking about open source projects to share experiments, models and conclussions.

This project intends to set up the bases to fill the gap for the above scenarios.
