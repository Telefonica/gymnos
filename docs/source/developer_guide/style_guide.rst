Style guide
==============================

We follow PEP8 conventions with some minor modifications for convenience and better readability:

    - We follow **E501** standard but our max line length is **120 characters**
    - We ignore the following code standards:

        * **E221** (Multiple spaces before operator)
        * **W504** (Line break occurred after a binary operator)

To run flake8 to check if your code sticks to the conventions, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash

    flake8
